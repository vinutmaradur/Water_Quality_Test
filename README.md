## Water Quality Prediction Application 💧
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the potability of water based on various water quality parameters. It uses machine learning algorithms, particularly the XGBoost Classifier, to determine whether the water is safe for drinking.

## About Dataset 📊

The water_potability.csv dataset contains information about water samples and their potability status. This dataset can be used to build machine learning models to predict whether water is safe for drinking based on its physical and chemical properties.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset includes 10 columns:

1. pH 🧪:

- A measure of how acidic or basic water is.
- **Range**: 0 to 14
- Drinking water should ideally have a pH between 6.5 and 8.5.
  
2. Hardness 💎:

- Represents the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions in water.
- **Unit**: mg/L
- High levels of hardness can cause scaling in pipes and reduce soap effectiveness.
  
3. Solids 🌊:

- Total dissolved solids (TDS) in water.
- **Unit**: ppm (parts per million)
- Excessive solids can affect taste and health.
  
4. Chloramines 🧼:

- Amount of chloramines present in water.
- **Unit**: ppm
- Chloramines are used for water disinfection but should be within safe levels.
  
5. Sulfate 🧂:

- Concentration of sulfate ions in water.
- **Unit**: mg/L
- High sulfate levels can cause a laxative effect.
  
6. Conductivity ⚡:

- Electrical conductivity of water, indicating the ion concentration.
- **Unit**: µS/cm
- Helps understand the mineral content in water.
  
7. Organic_carbon 🌱:

- Amount of organic carbon in water.
- **Unit**: ppm
- High levels can indicate contamination from organic waste.
  
8. Trihalomethanes 🧴:

- Concentration of trihalomethanes in water.
- **Unit**: µg/L
- Byproduct of chlorination; excessive levels are harmful.
  
9. Turbidity 🌪️:

- Cloudiness of water caused by suspended particles.
- **Unit**: NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit)
- High turbidity can harbor harmful microorganisms.
  
10. Potability  🚰:

- A binary indicator of water safety.
- Values:
   - 0: Not Potable 🛑 (Unsafe for drinking)
   - 1: Potable ✅ (Safe for drinking)
     
# Usage
This dataset is ideal for:

- Building machine learning models for classification problems.
- Analyzing the quality of water based on various features.
- Understanding the impact of water properties on its potability.

## Features 🎯

- **Interactive User Interface**: Users can input water quality parameters and get predictions on water potability.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A trained XGBoost model is used to classify water as potable or non-potable.
- **Dataset Handling**: The app preprocesses the water potability dataset to handle missing values before training the model.
